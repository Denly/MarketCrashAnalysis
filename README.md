Estimating critical time period for a LPPL curve
A Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model is applied to see if it can accurately predict critical turning points in its exponential growth cycle.
LPPL models have their origins in statistical physics and are used to determine when a system is reaching a critical point. 
While the original applications were in areas such as magnetism and seismology, the first use in economics was by Didier Sornette in 1996, 
applying the search for critical points to the October 1987 market crash.
There have also been several studies on other financial assets including currency markets.
